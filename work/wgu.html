				<h3>Role &amp; Responsibilities</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Sr. <abbr>UX</abbr> Designer &amp; Interim Product Manager</li>
					<li>Defined the vision and strategy for the <abbr>WGU</abbr>&rsquo;s mobile app first release, balancing academic and business objectives with student needs.</li>
					<li>Conducted research to deeply understand student pain points and user needs.</li>
					<li>Created interactive prototypes and validated concepts with users.</li>
					<li>Facilitated story mapping sessions with engineers and collaborated closely with designers.</li>
					<li>Worked directly with executive and academic stakeholders to ensure alignment and gain buy-in.</li>
				</ol>
				<h4>Use Case</h4>
				<h3>Mobile Learning Experience for WGU Students</h3>
				<p>WGU students, primarily working adults with families, needed greater flexibility to study, access course materials, and track their progress outside of a desktop computer. Since their programs are designed for self-paced learning, providing students with mobile access to curriculum, assignments, progress tracking, and mentor support was crucial to their educational success.</p>
				<h3>Desired Outcome</h3>
				<p>Deliver a mobile app that empowers WGU students to access their educational resources anytime, anywhere, on any device. In my role as Sr. UX Designer and interim Product Manager, I led the direction and vision for the app, partnering with stakeholders to establish a roadmap for the initial release and crafting a holistic, cross-functional approach to support students in achieving their educational goals.</p>

				</div>
				<h3>Design Process</h3>
				<p>This project required deep collaboration across teams and with executive and academic leaders, each bringing unique perspectives and goals.</p>
				<ol>
					<li><em>Research &amp; Stakeholder Engagement:</em> Conducted interviews with <abbr>WGU</abbr> students to understand the demands of balancing work, family, and study. These insights highlighted the importance of mobile flexibility and influenced the roadmap and app features.</li>
					<li><em>Prototyping &amp; Cross-Functional Collaboration:</em> I worked closely with engineers and other designers, mapping user stories and developing prototypes to iterate on design concepts. This inclusive process helped us develop a seamless, holistic mobile experience.</li>
					<li><em>Vision &amp; Team Scaling:</em> Initially acting as both Product Manager and Designer, I set the app&rsquo;s strategic direction and aligned the team around a shared vision. As the project grew, I transitioned to a design-focused role as a dedicated Product Manager and engineering teams were added, ensuring the scalability of the project across iOS and Android.</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Outcome</h3>
				<p>Our mobile app empowered students to engage with their studies on their own schedules and from any location. This solution supported <abbr>WGU</abbr>&rsquo;s mission to provide accessible, flexible education for working adults and set the foundation for ongoing development and enhancements as the team expanded.</p>
