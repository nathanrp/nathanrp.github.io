		<h3>About <abbr>WGU</abbr></h3>
		<p><abbr>WGU</abbr> is an online university that practices compentency-based learning. Competency-based learning measures skills and learning rather than time spent in a classroom.</p>
		<h3>Roles &amp; Responsibilities</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Sr. <abbr>UX</abbr> Designer</li>
			<li>Product Manager</li>
			<li>Research</li>
			<li>Prototyping</li>
			<li>Worked closely with executive and academic stakeholders</li>
			<li>Worked across teams and product areas to create a holistic user-experience</li>
		</ol>
		<p>I played the role of product manager and designer for about the first ~9 months. I set the the direction and vision for the app, worked with the stakeholders to outline a roadmap of what our first release would look like.</p>
		<h3>Customer Problem</h3>
		<p>Students really had no way of studying, and making progress except at a desktop computer. <abbr>WGU</abbr> students tend to be working adults with families, and their programs are setup so students can work at their own pace. So giving them access to the curriculum, assignments, track progress, and have access to their mentors anywhere, anytime, on any device was really important to helping them make progress in their education.</p>
		<h3>Design &amp; Process</h3>
		<p>I conducted research with students, <a href="https://www.jpattonassociates.com/story-mapping/" target="_blank">story mapped</a> and prototyped with engineers and collaborated with other designers. Something unique about this project and process was at higher education institutions, stakeholders included business and academic leadership.</p>

		<p>By the time I ended up leaving <abbr>WGU</abbr>, the team had grown to include a product manager, and on and off shore engineering teams for both iOS and Android devices.</p>
